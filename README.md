# Grocery-Cart
People spend hundreds of rupees on groceries every month, but don’t have a great understanding of how much they’re actually consuming and in what quantities. Our website would allow users to feed data about their purchases and the system would give them statistics, help plan their grocery.
Statsitics is the main feature of this project which differentiate Grocery-cart from other e-shopping sites
